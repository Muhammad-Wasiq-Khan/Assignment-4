    <h1>Ford Mustang</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The Ford Mustang is a series of American automobiles manufactured by Ford. In continuous production since
        1964,
        the Mustang is currently the longest-produced Ford car nameplate. Currently in its seventh generation, it is
        the
        fifth-best selling Ford car nameplate. The namesake of the "pony car" automobile segment, the Mustang was
        developed as a highly styled line of sporty coupes and convertibles derived from existing model lines,
        initially
        distinguished by "long hood, short deck" proportions.Originally predicted to sell 100,000 vehicles yearly,
        the
        1965 Mustang became the most successful vehicle launch since the 1927 Model A.[4] Introduced on April 17,
        1964[5] (16 days after the Plymouth Barracuda), over 400,000 units were sold in its first year; the
        one-millionth Mustang was sold within two years of its launch.[6] In August 2018, Ford produced the
        10-millionth
        Mustang; matching the first 1965 Mustang, the vehicle was a 2019 Wimbledon White convertible with a V8
        engine.
