    <h1>Ford Fusion</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The Ford Fusion is a mid-size car that was manufactured and marketed by the Ford Motor Company.From the 2006
        through 2020 model years, two generations of the Fusion have been produced in gasoline, gas/electric hybrid,
        and
        gas/plug-in electric hybrid variants. The Fusion was manufactured at Ford's Hermosillo Stamping and Assembly
        plant in Sonora, Mexico, alongside the Lincoln MKZ, and formerly the Mercury Milan,both of which share its
        CD3
        platform.

        Production on the first Fusions began on August 1, 2005. The Fusion replaced the Mondeo for the Latin
        American
        markets, except in Argentina (where the current European Mondeo is available); in the United States and
        Canada
        it superseded the then mid-size Taurus and the compact Contour. The Fusion is positioned between the compact
        Ford Focus and the full-size Ford Taurus. In the Middle East, this model is sold alongside the Mondeo.
        Versions
        sold there are available only with the 2.5-liter engine. Unlike in the United States, Canada, and Latin
        America,
        no V6 engine is available in that region.The same is true in South Korea, where only the 2.5-liter engines
        (including those for the hybrid model) are available as of the 2012 model year.

        The second generation line-up includes a gasoline engine option, an EcoBoost engine option, a
        next-generation
        hybrid model, and a plug-in hybrid version, the Ford Fusion Energi, making the Ford Fusion the first
        production
        sedan to offer these four options. Sales of the gasoline-powered and hybrid versions began in the U.S. in
        October 2012 under the 2013 model. Sales in Europe and Asia as Ford Mondeo began in 2015, along with South
        Africa, where the Fusion name was used.Deliveries of the Fusion Energi began in the U.S. in February 2013.
        The
        entire 2013 Fusion line-up was awarded with the 2013 Green Car of the Year at the 2012 Los Angeles Auto
        Show. In
        2019, the Fusion was the seventh-best selling car in the United States.</p>
