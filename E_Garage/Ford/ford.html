    <p>Ford Motor Company (commonly known as Ford) is an American multinational automobile manufacturer headquartered in
        Dearborn, Michigan, United States. It was founded by Henry Ford and incorporated on June 16, 1903. The company
        sells automobiles and commercial vehicles under the Ford brand, and luxury cars under its Lincoln brand. The
        company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the single-letter ticker symbol F and is controlled by
        the Ford family. They have minority ownership but a plurality of the voting power.June 16, 1903;
        Ford introduced methods for large-scale manufacturing of cars and large-scale management of an industrial
        workforce using elaborately engineered manufacturing sequences typified by moving assembly lines. By 1914, these
        methods were known around the world as Fordism. Ford's former UK subsidiaries Jaguar and Land Rover, acquired in
        1989 and 2000, respectively, were sold to the Indian automaker Tata Motors in March 2008. Ford owned the Swedish
        automaker Volvo from 1999 to 2010.In the third quarter of 2010, Ford discontinued the Mercury brand, under which
        it had marketed upscale cars in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the Middle East since 1938.

        Ford is the second-largest U.S.-based automaker, behind General Motors, and the sixth-largest in the world,
        behind Toyota, Volkswagen Group, Hyundai Motor Group, Stellantis, and General Motors, based on 2022 vehicle
        production.The company went public in 1956 but the Ford family, through special Class B shares, retain 40
        percent of the voting rights. During the 2008-2010 automotive industry crisis, the company struggled financially
        but did not have to be rescued by the federal government, unlike the other two major US automakers. Ford Motors
        has since returned to profitability,and was the eleventh-ranked overall American-based company in the 2018
        Fortune 500 list, based on global revenues in 2017 of $156.7 billion.In 2023, Ford produced 4.4 million
        automobiles, and employed about 177,000 employees worldwide. The company operates joint ventures in China
        (Changan Ford and Jiangling Ford), Taiwan (Ford Lio Ho), Thailand (AutoAlliance Thailand), and Turkey (Ford
        Otosan). Ford owns a 32% stake in China's Jiangling Motors.</p>
