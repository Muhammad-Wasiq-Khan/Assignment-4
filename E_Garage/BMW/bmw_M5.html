    <h1>BMW M5 (F90)</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The F90 M5 is based on the G30 5 Series and uses an all-wheel drive ("xDrive") powertrain, being the first
        time
        that an M5 has not been rear-wheel drive.However the all-wheel drive system is biased towards the rear
        wheels.
        It can also be configured to send power to the rear wheels only, if the electronic stability control (ESC)
        is
        disabled. The transmission is an 8-speed ZF GA8HP75Z automatic.

        The exterior of the M5 was designed by Seungmo Lim. The car was unveiled at the Gamescom in August 2017, to
        promote the launch of Need for Speed Payback.The M5 was also shown at the Frankfurt Motor Show (IAA) in
        September 2017. The M5 is produced alongside regular 5 Series models at the BMW Dingolfing Plant in Germany.

        The F90 M5 accelerates from a standstill to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.4 seconds,[103] and to 200 km/h (124 mph)
        in
        11.1 seconds.In imperial measurements 60 mph (97 km/h) is reached in 2.8 seconds and 100 mph (161 km/h) in
        6.6
        seconds. The standing 400m (quarter mile) is achieved in 10.9 seconds, making this iteration of the M5 a
        10-second car.The top speed is limited to 250 km/h (155 mph), or 305 km/h (190 mph) with the optional M
        Driver's
        Pack.Despite the added weight of the all-wheel drive components, the F90 M5 is 40 kg (88 lb) lighter than
        the
        previous generation M5.

        In December 2017, the F90 M5 set the Guinness World Record for "Longest continuous vehicle drift" and
        "Longest
        twin vehicle drift (water assisted)" on a wet skidpad, with distances of 374 and 79 km (232 and 49 mi)
        respectively.The F90 M5 recorded a NÃ¼rburgring lap time of 7:38.92 in a test by sport auto</p>
