    <h1>BMW M2</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The BMW M2 is a high-performance version of the BMW 2 Series automobile developed by BMW's motorsport
        division,
        BMW M GmbH. As the 2 Series replaced the 1 Series coup√© and convertible models, the first-generation M2 was
        marketed as the most basic M model in the range.

        The first-generation M2 used the F8x chassis from the M3/M4, codenamed F87 and featured the BMW N55 series
        engine, while its successors, the M2 Competition and M2 CS, featured a twin-turbocharged engine developed by
        BMW
        M GmbH (S55 engine).

        The second-generation M2 uses the CLAR platform, codenamed G87, which it shares with the G80 M3 and G82 M4.
        It
        features the BMW S58 twin-turbocharged inline-six engine, developed by BMW M GmbH</p>
