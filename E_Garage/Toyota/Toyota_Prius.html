    <h1>Toyota Prius</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The Toyota Prius is a compact/small family liftback (supermini/subcompact sedan until 2003) produced by
        Toyota.
        The Prius has a hybrid drivetrain, combined with an internal combustion engine and an electric motor.
        Initially
        offered as a four-door sedan, it has been produced only as a five-door liftback since 2003.The Prius was
        developed by Toyota to be the "car for the 21st century"; it was the first mass-produced hybrid
        vehicle,first
        going on sale in Japan in 1997 at all four Toyota Japan dealership chains,and subsequently introduced
        worldwide
        in 2000.

        In 2011, Toyota expanded the Prius family to include the Prius v, an MPV, and the Prius c, a subcompact
        hatchback. The production version of the Prius plug-in hybrid was released in 2012. The second generation of
        the
        plug-in variant, the Prius Prime, was released in the U.S. in November 2016.The Prius family totaled global
        cumulative sales of 6.1 million units in January 2017, representing 61% of the 10 million hybrids sold
        worldwide
        by Toyota since 1997.Toyota sells the Prius in over 90 markets, with Japan and the United States being its
        largest markets.</p>
