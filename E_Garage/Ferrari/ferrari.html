    <p>Ferrari S.p.A. is an Italian luxury sports car manufacturer based in Maranello.
        Founded in 1939 by Enzo Ferrari
        (1898-1988), the company built its first car in 1940, adopted its current name in 1945, and began to produce its
        current line of road cars in 1947. Ferrari became a public company in 1960, and from 1963 to 2014 it was a
        subsidiary of Fiat S.p.A. It was spun off from Fiat's successor entity, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, in 2016. The
        company currently offers a large model range which includes several supercars, grand tourers, and one SUV. Many
        early Ferraris, dating to the 1950s and 1960s, count among the most expensive cars ever sold at auction.

        Throughout its history, the company has been noted for its continued participation in racing, especially in
        Formula One, where its team, Scuderia Ferrari, is the series' single oldest and most successful. Scuderia
        Ferrari has raced since 1929, first in Grand Prix events and later in Formula One, where it holds many records.
        Historically, Ferrari was also highly active in sports car racing, where its cars took many wins in races such
        as the Mille Miglia, Targa Florio and 24 Hours of Le Mans, as well as several overall victories in the World
        Sportscar Championship. Scuderia Ferrari fans, commonly called tifosi, are known for their passion and loyalty
        to the team.

        Ferrari is one of the world's strongest brands, and it maintains a brand image built around racing heritage,
        luxury, and exclusivity. As of May 2023, Ferrari is also one of the largest car manufacturers by market
        capitalisation, with a value of approximately US$85.5 billion</p>
